I am marking this repository as **DEPRECIATED** because, in addition to lacking more refined curation, it will be part of a new repository that I call open-docs.

The methods I used to prepare this material using the machine do not match my perception of its current popular use.

# Development Cheat Sheets Repository

## Script for Compression

To facilitate project compression and submission for review or analysis, a `compress_project.sh` script is included. This script:

- Compresses the current repository into a high-compression ZIP file.
- Names the file using the format `md_cheat-sheets_<timestamp>.zip`.
- Automates the generation of dated backups.

### Usage Instructions

1. Ensure the script is located in the repository root.
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x compress_project.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./compress_project.sh
   ```
   This will create a ZIP file in the repository root, timestamped in its name.

## Usage

Each cheat sheet is organized to provide a quick and easy reference for common commands and configurations. Open the relevant file for the technology or tool you're working with.
